# PublishPress Authors


## Description

By default, WordPress only allows you to add one author to each post. The Multiple Authors add-on allows you to add as many authors you want.

The Multiple authors plugin allows you to add the authors, and also it enables you to display their information. With this add-on, you can show the authorsâ€™ names, images and bios.

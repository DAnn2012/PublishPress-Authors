Feature: Users deletion
  In order to delete users on different scenarios
  As an admin
  I need to be able to choose what to do with the author terms and content owned by the user before the user is deleted

  Background:
    Given the user "admin_user_deletion" exists with role "administrator"
    And I am logged in as "admin_user_deletion"
    And following users exist
      | user_login | user_role |
      | john       | author    |
      | peter      | author    |
      | mary       | author    |
      | jack       | author    |
      | lucy       | author    |
      | oprah      | author    |
      | patrick    | author    |
      | jonatan    | author    |
      | erick      | author    |
      | simon      | author    |
      | joshua     | author    |
